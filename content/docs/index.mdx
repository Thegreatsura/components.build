description: components.build is an open-source standard for building modern, composable and accessible UI components.
---

Modern web applications are built on reusable UI components and how we design, build, and share them is important. This specification aims to establish a formal, open standard for building open-source UI components for the modern web.

It is co-authored by <Author name="Hayden Bleasel" image="https://github.com/haydenbleasel.png" href="https://x.com/haydenbleasel" /> and <Author name="shadcn" image="https://github.com/shadcn.png" href="https://x.com/shadcn" />, with contributions from the open-source community and informed by popular projects in the React ecosystem.

The goal is to help open-source maintainers and senior front-end engineers create components that are composable, accessible, and easy to adopt across projects.

## What is this specification?

This spec is not a tutorial or course on React, nor a promotion for any specific component library or registry. Instead, it provides high-level guidelines, best practices, and a common terminology for designing UI components.

By following this specification, developers can ensure their components are consistent with modern expectations and can integrate smoothly into any codebase.

## Who is this for?

We're writing this for open-source maintainers and experienced front-end engineers who build and distribute component libraries or design systems. We assume you are familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript and React.

All examples will use React (with JSX/TSX) for concreteness, but we hope the fundamental concepts apply to other frameworks like Vue, Svelte, or Angular.

In other words, this spec’s philosophy is framework-agnostic – whether you build with React or another library, you should emphasize the same principles of composition, accessibility, and maintainability.
