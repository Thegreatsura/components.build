description: Using component marketplaces to share your components.
---

Component marketplaces represent another new paradigm in how developers share and discover UI components. Platforms like [21st.dev](https://21st.dev) have emerged as centralized hubs where creators can publish components and consumers can discover, preview, and install them seamlessly.

These marketplaces combine the accessibility of registries with the discoverability of traditional package repositories, creating vibrant ecosystems for component sharing.

## How Marketplaces Work

When you publish to a marketplace, the platform typically:

1. **Hosts your component code** - No need to manage your own infrastructure
2. **Provides a unified CLI** - Users install components through the marketplace's tooling
3. **Generates previews** - Live demos and interactive examples are created automatically
4. **Handles discovery** - Search, categories, and recommendations surface relevant components

For example, installing from 21st.dev uses the familiar shadcn CLI pattern:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx shadcn@latest add https://21st.dev/r/haydenbleasel/dialog-stack
```

The marketplace handles serving the component metadata and source code, making the installation process seamless.

## Benefits of Component Marketplaces

Marketplaces offer unique advantages that neither registries nor npm packages can match on their own.

### For Component Authors

#### Distribution Without Infrastructure

Publishing to a marketplace eliminates infrastructure concerns. You don't need to setup hosting for your components, or manage CDN distribution.

The marketplace handles all of this, letting you focus on creating great components.

#### Built-in Audience

Marketplaces aggregate demand. When developers visit 21st.dev or similar platforms, they're actively looking for components. Your work gets discovered organically through search, categories, and recommendations. 

This built-in traffic means you don't need to market your components independently.

#### Monetization Opportunities

Some marketplaces enable creators to monetize their work through premium component tiers, sponsorship programs, usage-based pricing, and one-time purchase models.

This creates sustainable incentives for maintaining high-quality components.

#### Community Feedback

Marketplaces typically include rating systems, comment sections, usage analytics, and issue tracking.

This feedback loop helps you understand how developers use your components and what improvements they need.

### For Component Consumers

#### Curated Discovery

Unlike searching through GitHub or npm, marketplaces offer curated experiences:

```
Browse by category:
├── Marketing
│   ├── Heroes
│   ├── Pricing
│   └── Testimonials
├── Application
│   ├── Dashboards
│   ├── Forms
│   └── Data Display
└── E-commerce
    ├── Product Cards
    ├── Cart
    └── Checkout
```

This organization makes finding the right component significantly faster.

#### Quality Assurance

Many marketplaces implement review processes. Components might go through code quality checks, accessibility audits, performance testing, and documentation review.

This curation ensures a baseline quality that self-published components might lack.

#### Unified Tooling

Using a single CLI for all marketplace components simplifies workflow. You can install any component from the marketplace using the same command:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx shadcn@latest add https://21st.dev/r/<author>/<component>
```

## Challenges of Marketplaces

While marketplaces offer compelling benefits, they also introduce unique challenges.

### For Authors

#### Competition and Visibility

In a crowded marketplace, standing out becomes difficult. You're competing with hundreds of similar components, established creators with followings, featured or sponsored content, and algorithm-driven recommendations.

Success requires more than just good code - you need compelling previews, excellent documentation, and often, active promotion.

#### Platform Dependency

Publishing on a marketplace means accepting their terms of service, revenue sharing models, technical requirements, and review processes.

If the platform changes policies or shuts down, your distribution channel disappears.

#### Quality Pressure

Marketplace users expect polished, production-ready components. This means comprehensive documentation, multiple demo variations, responsive design, cross-browser testing, and accessibility compliance.

Meeting these expectations requires significant time investment beyond just writing component code.

### For Consumers

#### Variable Quality

Despite review processes, marketplace quality varies wildly. You might encounter abandoned components with outdated dependencies, poorly documented code, components that work in demos but break in production, and inconsistent coding styles across different authors.

Due diligence is still required when selecting components.

#### Lock-in Concerns

While marketplaces use standard tools like the shadcn CLI, they might introduce proprietary metadata formats, custom configuration requirements, and platform-specific dependencies.

This can make migrating away from the marketplace difficult.

#### Discovery Paradox

Too much choice can be paralyzing. When searching for a button component, finding 200 options doesn't necessarily help. You need to evaluate multiple similar components, compare subtle differences, assess long-term maintainability, and consider author reputation.

This evaluation process can take longer than building the component yourself.
